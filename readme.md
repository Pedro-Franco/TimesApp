# Howdy, mate!
You're doing a great job here! Keep it up!
You have much talent to visual design and code. I'm impressed!
Your approach to dividing the components into small pieces is very good.

### For the next steps, we would consider the following:
[ ] Organize the navigation between the screens.
> As it is, we just have a navigation between the screens without the possibility to navigate between the screens 1 to 3. We would need to add a navigation between the screens to make it easy to add the player's name.
> Once the teams are being presented on the main screen, the click on it would take the user to the screen 3, where the user would be able to add the player's name.

[ ] Save the team name and the player's name on storage.
> We have three simple ways to do it, and you will find the way to use it on the digital content:
> 1. Using the key-value model with AsyncStorage (3rd theme - 1st topic)
> 2. Using a relational database with SQLite (3rd theme - 2nd topic)
> 3. Using the Realm Database (3rd theme - 3rd topic)

You also can find the documentation and some samples to these topics here:
- https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage
- https://blog.logrocket.com/using-sqlite-with-react-native
- https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-use-realm-local-db-in-react-native-4e9f9dfcbc53

[ ] Get from an API some soccer results (you can earn much money with this).
> There exist many APIs to get the soccer results. You can find some of them here: https://rapidapi.com/category/Sports.
> You will find a support content to consume an API on the 4th theme of the digital content.

That's all, mate! Those points are my requirements for your next delivery (and as I know, you can do it). Keep it up!
I want to see your progress in the next steps! You're doing a great job!
